📝 Abstract
A centralized profile platform for 100xEngineers cohort learners that enables peer-to-peer
discovery, project showcase, and controlled external talent visibility. The platform integrates
learner profiles with their projects, provides AI-powered search capabilities, and offers
role-based access to progress data while maintaining high security standards.

🎯 Business Objectives

• Enable better peer networking and collaboration within and across cohorts ​
• Increase external visibility for learners to attract recruiters, investors, and partners ​
• Provide mentors with comprehensive mentee progress visibility ​
• Improve cohort completion rates through peer motivation and progress transparency ​
• Generate qualified external interest and partnership opportunities for 100xEngineers

How many external inquiries are we
generating

🏆 Success Criteria
• 80% of learners complete their profiles within first week ​
• Average 5+ searches per active user per week ​
• 50+ meaningful peer connections made in first month ​
• 10+ qualified external contact requests routed through team ​
• Mentors actively monitoring mentee progress weekly

🚶‍♀️ User Journeys

Learner Journey: Signs in with credentials → Views own progress dashboard → Updates
profile with new skills/projects → Searches for peers with similar interests → Connects for
collaboration → Submits new project to showcase
Mentor Journey: Logs in → Reviews mentee progress across cohort → Identifies learners
needing support → Provides targeted guidance based on progress data
External Audience Journey: Discovers talent through 100xEngineers → Views public
project showcase → Requests connection through team → Team facilitates appropriate
introductions

📖 Scenarios

• Learner searching for React developers in their cohort for a team project ​
• Mentor identifying learners with low assignment completion rates ​
• External recruiter discovering AI/ML talent through project showcase ​
• Cross-cohort learner finding potential co-founders with complementary skills ​
• Investor exploring innovative projects from recent graduates

🕹️ User Flow

Happy Path: Login → Dashboard (role-specific) → Profile/Progress View → Search/Browse
→ Connect/Contact → Project Submission/View
Key Alternatives:
• External users → Public project showcase → Contact team → Team facilitates connection
• Mentors → Cohort overview → Individual mentee drill-down → Progress tracking

🧮 Data Requirements
• Purpose: Semantic search across learner profiles, skills, and projects
• Preparation: Clean and structure existing Launchpad data, project submissions
• Sources: Launchpad forms, LMS API, existing project database
• Coverage: All 500 learners, their domains, interests, skill levels, project metadata
• Ongoing Collection: Real-time sync with project submissions, profile updates

💬 Prompt Requirements

• Search Enhancement: Convert natural language queries to structured search parameters
• Privacy Compliance: Never expose personal identifiable information in results ​
• Result Formatting: Return structured data matching frontend expectations ​
• Fallback Handling: Graceful degradation when AI search fails to keyword search

🧪 Testing & Measurement

• Offline Evaluation: Test search relevance with sample queries against known good results
• A/B Testing: Not feasible in 3-day timeline, launch with monitoring ​
• Performance Monitoring: Track search latency, success rates, user engagement ​
• Rollback Plan: Fall back to basic keyword search if AI search fails

⚠️ Risks & Mitigations
RISK

MITIGATION

4-day timeline too aggressive

Leverage existing project showcase app
maximally

LMS API integration complexity

Take help from the Edmingle support team

AI search implementation time

Start with basic keyword search, add AI later

Data security breach

Use unique IDs only, no PII in database

Low user adoption

Pre-populate profiles, provide clear value props

💰 Costs

• Development: 3 days × 1-2 developers (internal cost) ​
• Infrastructure: Minimal hosting costs for web application ​
• AI/Search: Open source models, no API costs ​
• Data Storage: Existing database infrastructure

🔗 Assumptions & Dependencies

• Existing project showcase app can be extended rather than rebuilt ​
• LMS API documentation is sufficient for required integrations​
• Launchpad data is clean and structured for import (Done manually last week)​
• Team can create 500 user accounts and distribute credentials in timeline ​
• Basic web hosting infrastructure is available ​
• External users will accept routing through 100xEngineers team

🔒 Compliance/Privacy/Legal

• Data Minimization: Use unique learner IDs (100xC[batch][number]) instead of personal
data​
• Access Controls: Role-based permissions (learners see own data, mentors see mentees)
• External Access: All external contact routed through 100xEngineers team ​
• Data Retention: TBD based on organizational policies

📣 GTM/Rollout Plan

Day 1-3: Core development with full LMS integration ​
Day 4: Feature completion and integration testing​
Day 5: Testing, bug fixes, credential distribution, launch ​
Week 1: Monitor adoption, gather feedback, iterate ​
Week 2-4: Feature refinement, external outreach for hiring/investment opportunities
Launch Strategy:
• Email credentials to all 500 learners and mentors ​
• Demo session for mentors on progress tracking features​
• Learner onboarding guide for profile completion ​
• Gradual external audience introduction through team
